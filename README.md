# InReach-Avalanche-Canada-RSS-Feed
This project serves a few personal purposes for me, and hopefully if you are reading this it can help you too!

###### What's the problem?
Avalanche Canada creates daily detailed three day forecasts for people using the backcountry in the winter. These reports can help to plan routes, make critical decisions, and determine daily activities. The only problem is that you need an internet connection to get the latest forecast and internet can be hard to come by in the backcountry, especially when you are on a multi-day trip in the backcountry, however many people do carry Garmin Inreach satellite communication devices with them as a safety measure.

###### How does this project help?
I am hoping to turn this project into something that will be able to get the RSS feed from [Avalanche Canada] (https://avalanche.ca) for your desired region, remove the HTML characters from the text, and send the forecast to a specified inReach device. Ideally this script would run once a day on days tha I have started to do this using the Twilio API, but if you can think of a better way I would love to hear it!

###### PS
This is also a project for me to learn more about git / github, programming, APIs, and automation of running scripts.
